# 📥 How to Get Started

## For GitHub Users

1. Click the green `Use this template` button at the top right.
2. ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Make sure it is a **Private** repository, otherwise someone can copy your work!
3. Name your new repository.

## For Most Students (Non-GitHub)

If you just want the folders on your computer:

1. Click the `<> Code` button.
2. Select `Download ZIP`.
3. **Extract the ZIP** to your "Documents" or "IT Projects" folder.
4. **Cleanup**: Once you have the folders, you can safely delete the following to keep your project tidy:
    - `.github` folder
    - `README.md` file

# ⭐ Pro-Tips for the 100%

- **Backup often**: I lost one of my PATs because I didn't do this. Don't just save on a flash drive; they fail! (Trust me). Keep a copy in the cloud (OneDrive/Google Drive).
- **Good coding practices**: Follow consistent naming conventions and format your code (indentation is key!).
- **The "Mom" Test**: If your mom can't figure out how to use your PAT, it's too complicated. Simplify it!
- **Follow the rubric**: I missed my 100% because I thought four points for an eight-point question was enough. **Read the rubric twice!**

# 🍀 Good luck!
